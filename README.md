## Discussion points from the "Issues"

### What's useful

- What is a *useful* way to characterize biodiversity (e.g. for conservation or for theory)?
- What about other axes of biodiversity like behavior?
- Are species concepts useful or should we focus more on degree of differentiation in X as a measure of diversity (e.g. X = traits or genes)?
- Can we be "hierarchically agnostic" about biodiversity (e.g. with metagenomics)?
- This hierarchical characterization is a social construct: it's changed before, how will it change again?


### What are the processes

- How do levels of biodiversity feedback on one another? E.g. how do local processes scale up to affect genetic patterns and speciation?
- How does management of single populations impact larger-scale biodiversity?
- What are the drivers of within population diversity?
- What about extinction?


### What are the tools

- What tools can we use to study biodiversity at different scales?
- Is there any hope of clear-cut answers to biodiversity questions, or is it always the kitchen sink?
- How does biodiversity influence ecosystem stability?
- How do we study single populations in the context of ecosystem biodiversity?


## Class discussion

### Discussion prompts:

- We can see there's a range (e.g. a heron versus a human or genes to ecosystems)--why do we have a burning need to draw a line through it?
- Using traits to study biodiversity: missing the forest for the trees?  How do we balance generality and specificity in modeling?
- What are species concepts?
- Is variation in life discrete?
- How can we/should we abandon species categories in modeling biodiversity?

### Follow-up resources

On the topic of species concepts, [de Queiroz (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0502030102) offers some good definitions and thoughts. For one take on why species delimitations might be meaningful (i.e. encode real information about the biology of diversity) see this commentary from [Harte et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1086/668821).

We went into how humans use concepts from biology to justify categorizing each other into in-groups and out-groups, but we also thought it's worth noting that humans seem to have evolved to be nice to each other too, here's a paper about that: [Ak√ßay et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0904357106).

Here are some papers about using traits: [Kearney et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.13829)---thanks Eric for sharing; [McGill et al. (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2006.02.002); [Violle et al. (2007)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2007.15559.x).

Here's a paper about calculating diversity from a phylogenetic perspective: .  And here's one about calculating it from a trait-based perspective: .  We'll get a lot deeper into that later in the course.

Here's the foundational paper proposing the use of phylogenies for studying modes of assembly [Webb et al. (2022)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3069271
)---we'll also get a lot deeper into this later on.  And here's some examples of how we realized the simple phylogenetic approach proposed by Webb et al. (2002) needed more nuance---especially that phylogenetic relatedness doesn't necessarily correspond to trait differences: [Graham et al. (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0901649106) thought they found something cool with hummingbird phylogenies.  Then a few years later [Graham et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1890/11-0493.1) realized it was a lot more complex and traits don't necessarily follow phylogeny.  [Lawing et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.01986) did a nice job integrating insights form phylogeny and traits.
