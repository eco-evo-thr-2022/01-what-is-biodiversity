## Discussion points from the "Issues"

### What's useful

- What is a *useful* way to characterize biodiversity (e.g. for conservation or for theory)?
- What about other axes of biodiversity like behavior?
- Are species concepts useful or should we focus more on degree of differentiation in X as a measure of diversity (e.g. X = traits or genes)?
- Can we be "hierarchically agnostic" about biodiversity (e.g. with metagenomics)?
- This hierarchical characterization is a social construct: it's changed before, how will it change again?


### What are the processes

- How do levels of biodiversity feedback on one another? E.g. how do local processes scale up to affect genetic patterns and speciation?
- How does management of single populations impact larger-scale biodiversity?
- What are the drivers of within population diversity?
- What about extinction?


### What are the tools

- What tools can we use to study biodiversity at different scales?
- Is there any hope of clear-cut answers to biodiversity questions, or is it always the kitchen sink?
- How does biodiversity influence ecosystem stability?
- How do we study single populations in the context of ecosystem biodiversity?


## Class discussion

### Discussion prompts:

- We can see there's a range (e.g. a heron versus a human or genes to ecosystems)--why do we have a burning need to draw a line through it?
- Using traits to study biodiversity: missing the forest for the trees?  How do we balance generality and specificity in modeling?
- What are species concepts?
- Is variation in life discrete?
- How can we/should we abandon species categories in modeling biodiversity?
